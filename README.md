## Abstract

We replicate all experiments from Gal & Ghahramani (2016) using a unified PyTorch implementation with Monte Carlo dropout: UCI-10 regression, Mauna Loa CO₂ extrapolation, solar irradiance interpolation, MNIST rotated-digit uncertainty, and the **Catch** reinforcement-learning demo. Our results closely match the original findings, confirming that dropout training minimizes a variational lower bound and yields well-calibrated epistemic uncertainty estimates. We also clarify the hyperparameter‐prior correspondence and offer practical guidance for deploying Bayesian dropout in modern systems.

## 1. Introduction

Deep neural networks achieve high accuracy but often lack uncertainty estimates. Bayesian neural networks address this limitation but are computationally expensive. Gal & Ghahramani (2016) showed that standard **dropout** approximates variational inference in a deep Gaussian Process framework. By retaining dropout at test time and averaging multiple stochastic forward passes—**MC dropout**—one obtains both predictive mean and variance. We reproduce their end-to-end experiments with modern tools and hardware.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Variational Interpretation

Training with dropout probability \(p\) and \(L_2\) weight-decay \(\lambda\) minimizes
\[
\mathcal L = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \ell\bigl(f(x_i;W\odot z_i),y_i\bigr) + \lambda\|W\|_2^2,
\]
where \(z_i \sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}(1-p)\). This objective corresponds to the KL divergence between a Bernoulli–Gaussian variational posterior \(q(W)\) and the true GP posterior.

### 2.2 Predictive Distribution

At test time with dropout enabled,
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb E[y^*] &\approx \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T f(x^*;W \odot z_t),\\
\mathrm{Var}[y^*] &\approx \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T f(x^*;W \odot z_t)^2 - \bigl(\mathbb E[y^*]\bigr)^2 + \tau^{-1},
\end{aligned}
\]
with \(\tau = \tfrac{2N\lambda}{p\ell^2}\) linking network hyperparameters \((p,\lambda)\) to the GP prior length‐scale \(\ell\).

## 5. Discussion

- **Calibration:** UCI log-likelihood gains validate well-calibrated epistemic uncertainty.  
- **Hyperparameter–Prior Link:** Flat validation LL along constant \(\tau\) lines confirms the theory.  
- **Model Limitations:** Bounded activations (Tanh) can understate uncertainty; Bernoulli variational posteriors cannot fully collapse as \(N\to\infty\).

## 6. Conclusion

We have faithfully reproduced all core experiments from Gal & Ghahramani (2016) using a modern PyTorch pipeline. Across regression, time series, classification, and reinforcement learning, MC Dropout delivers reliable uncertainty estimates and strong predictive performance. Its simplicity, scalability, and interpretability make it a robust baseline for Bayesian deep learning in contemporary applications.
